Spent a while looking at ZSWatch for inspiration. I also created the goal/feature list, weighing complexity, monetary cost, and power cost of the features I thought of. I think they're roughly in order of importance.

Now that I think about it the first two "goals" are kind of a must so don't really count.
## Goals / Features
- Custom PCB
- Custom case (Will probably be 3D printed)
- Touchscreen
- Wifi + Bluetooth capabilities
- USB-C port
- Side buttons
- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer
- Rechargeable battery
- ~64 MB of storage
- App system
